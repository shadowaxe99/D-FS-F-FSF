Defendant Esteban Di Masi ("Di Masi") is an individual residing in Los Angeles County and is an employee or agent of Crosscheck.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the California Code of Civil Procedure because Defendants reside in and/or conduct business in this jurisdiction.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Gruen co-founded Crosscheck with the intent of creating a successful media and entertainment company. He held a significant membership interest and contributed substantial capital, time, and expertise. In reliance on the mutual Operating Agreement and the trust placed in him as a co-founder, Gruen performed all his duties and obligations to the company. Despite Gruen's contributions, Defendants conspired to squeeze him out of the company, dilute his interest, exclude him from decision-making, and misappropriate company assets for their own benefit. Defendants' actions constitute a breach of the Operating Agreement and fiduciary duties owed to Gruen, causing him significant financial harm and damage to his reputation.
